# JavaScript Technical Exercises
This repository contains a series of technical exercises in JavaScript to help you prepare for a technical exam or job interview. The exercises are organized by experience level: trainee/junior, mid-level, senior, and expert in JavaScript.

## Trainee
The trainee exercises are designed for those who have little or no experience in programming in JavaScript. These exercises focus on basic JavaScript concepts such as variables, data types, flow control structures, and functions. If you are completely new to JavaScript, the trainee exercises can be a good way to get familiar with the language and learn the basic fundamentals of programming. In these exercises, you will be asked to write simple functions and solve simple problems using JavaScript.

## Junior
The junior exercises are more advanced than the trainee ones and are designed for those who have some experience in programming in JavaScript. If you have worked with JavaScript before but are still learning, the junior exercises can be a good challenge for you.

## Mid-Level
The mid-level exercises are exercises where you practice arrays and searching with regular expressions.

## Senior
The senior exercises are more advanced and are designed for those who have experience in programming in JavaScript. These exercises focus on more advanced topics such as object-oriented programming, design patterns, error handling, promises, and DOM manipulation.

## JavaScript Expert
The expert JavaScript exercises are the most advanced and are designed for those who have extensive experience in programming in JavaScript. These exercises focus on advanced topics such as functional programming, complex algorithms, software architecture, and JavaScript frameworks.

### Success in your interview
Each level has several exercises for you to practice and improve your JavaScript skills. We hope that these exercises will help you prepare for a technical exam or job interview. Have fun coding!
